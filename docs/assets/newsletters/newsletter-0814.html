<p><strong>Meditation sit-in at ICE</strong></p>
<p>Wednesdays | 4:30-5:30 PM</p>
<p>ICE Building | 188 Harvest Lane | Williston at Tafts Corners</p>
<p>We sit as silent witnesses to the activities being conducted inside the building. We don’t engage with the employees or people passing by, but we hope that our presence and our signs provoke some questions. Bring a bench, chair or cushion–whatever enables you to sit comfortably. If you bring a sign, we hope that the message will respectfully raise questions about ICE’s policies and actions, and convey our appreciation for migrants, and their right to fair and legal treatment. Our intention is not to judge the people who work in the building, but to change attitudes and policies. Join us! </p>

<p><strong>Changing the rules in D.C.</strong></p>
<p>When Trump’s mob attacked the US Capitol and murdered police on January 6, 2021, he didn’t call out the National Guard. He said his hands were tied. Now, with crime down and nothing like a clear and present danger, he called out the troops to shock and awe the citizens of Washington. What changed? Nothing, really, except Trump feels like now is a good time to flex his muscles and distract his base from the mounting evidence of his sordid dealings with convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. It’s a dress rehearsal for a full-scale military dictatorship!</p>
