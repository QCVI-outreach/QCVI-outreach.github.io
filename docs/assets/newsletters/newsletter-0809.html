<h1><strong>What’s next for Queen City Indivisible?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Notes from the general membership meeting</strong></p>
<p>Last Tuesday, about thirty of us gathered to talk about what to do next. Thanks to everyone who came - we had a great time! Here’s what we learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Folks have lots of great ideas for actions based on their interests &amp; concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QCVI can’t do everything all at once!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, gather some people around you and starting “doing” your ideas - with or without QCVI support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As one participant said: any idea that you have energy for is the “right” idea &amp; will help the cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can learn as you go - you don’t need to know how to do everything ahead of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QCVI can offer support with input, brainstorming, clarifying, &amp; communication to our email list &amp; social media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want to support actions, events, programs, messages that are relevant to our mission, feasible, and have committed leadership. So, if you want QCVI support and endorsement:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out your idea: what, when, who, how, why, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe it in a few lines on our super-duper easy-to-use <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dINmNXaxpEHZudTRM1B/QY97y1GRbNzQ">web form</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ll review it, get back to you with suggestions, or send it to the Board to review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If approved, you’re essentially a semi-autonomous action committee of QCVI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We encourage you to view Indivisible’s <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIPRPzt7JXh7qEbMzKD/HjWqo0u6Gt80">One Million Rising</a> training as a model for your own action.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tell the Governor not to send our personal data to Trump!</strong></p>
<p>In July, the Agency of Human Services provided personal data, including names, addresses and Social Security Numbers, of Vermonters receiving food assistance to the Trump administration. By doing so they prevented Vermont from joining 20 other states suing the administration over this request.  AHS is now compiling data on recipients’ specific food purchases to submit. Details at <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIW5Zp3jGnLJYd75WYL/4g9AARL76zIA">Vermont Public</a> and <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIXkcHLsl6krUEF19rN/CAQG9ijgNhVB">Seven Days</a>.</p>
<p>Let the Governor know this is unacceptable. Call 802-828-3333, or send a message <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIZPeje2FQAPPpMwnAP/8vS30t7rQtNk">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Our hero: Attorney General Charity Clark</strong></p>
<p>AG Clark has sued the feds dozens of times to slow the mad power grab by the Feds. This would be a good time to thank her for taking every opportunity to protect the rights of Vermonters. You can send a message <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIb4hBwBjjZxLQUsQTR/EAkcgBCFR7HT">here</a></p>
<p><strong>What about the tariffs?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIcjjeELE2zVH1co3mT/6gikaZFVOlmV">Yale Budget Lab</a> has analyzed the Trump tariffs. Starting this week, c<strong>onsumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.3%, the highest since 1934, and the equivalent of an average per household income loss of $2,400. Prices for clothing and shoes will go up 40%, and 500,000 workers will lose jobs. All so Trump can have tax breaks for billionaires and build concentration camps.</strong></p>
