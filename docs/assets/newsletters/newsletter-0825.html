<p>September’s membership meeting will include a postcard party.

<p>**Vermont  Fair &amp; ****Impartial **<strong>Policing Policy (FIPP)</strong></p>
<p>The FIPP limits local police involvement in immigration enforcement: if an undocumented immigrant poses no threat to an officer or the public, <em>officers should not share their personal information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Border Patrol (CBP).</em> By law, all Vermont law enforcement agencies (sheriffs and municipal or state police) must adopt the policy and commit to treating everyone fairly. Community members are invited to provide comments on the latest version of the FIPP by <strong>September 1</strong>. You can find a copy of the policy <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dINmNXaxpEHZudTRM1B/kYUA1Wdt0N80">here</a> and an explainer <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIPRPzt7JXh7qEbMzKD/uzU2m9Mchj_d">here</a>.

<p><strong>Reach out to the Governor</strong></p>
<p>Send a thank you message to Governor Scott for refusing to send the Vermont National Guard to Washington D.C. to be part of Trump’s autocratic military occupation of our cities. Encourage him to check with VT Attorney General Charity Clark before cooperating with any intrusive and questionable requests by the Federal Government, in case Vermont might join a lawsuit challenging the request. You can reach the Governor <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIUQXMlZmTvld1z9tFJ/Tqc3GAeGzA-9">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Front Porch Forum</strong></p>
<p>We post our newsletters in our neighborhood Front Porch forum and they generate a lot of interest and action. You can help by posting on YOUR neighborhood forum. <a href="https://frontporchforum.com/">https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIW5Zp3jGnLJYd75WYL/02Ba6NTTNcLb</a> Thanks for the assist!</p>
<p><strong>Redistricting</strong></p>
<p>First, Trump had his flunkies in Texas redraw the state’s congressional district map to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Democrats and create 5 non-competitive seats for MAGA Republicans. Then, California Governor Newsom proposed doing the same in California to flip 5 seats the other way. However, in California, it has to go to the people for a vote. Redistricting is a bad idea in normal times, but these times aren’t normal. Unfortunately, the League of Women Voters in California has come out against Governor Newsom’s redistricting plan. LWV’s opinion does matter, and this amendment could fail if we don’t rally everyone to support it. Please consider sending them an email at <a href="mailto:lwvc@lwvc.org">lwvc@lwvc.org</a> asking them to change course.</p>
<p><strong>How to “win” an election</strong></p>
<p>How did the voters shift so rapidly from mild Progressivism to extreme autocracy-cum-fascism? One possibility is that they didn’t. The <a href="https://g6ptr.r.sp1-brevo.net/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIXkcHLsl6krUEF19rN/CY06zJh6hddg">Election Truth Alliance</a> has been investigating the possibility that the elections were rigged. In North Carolina, the precinct-level returns are striking: Trump got lots more votes on Election Day than other Republicans, but not in the mail-in ballots and only in precincts with more registered voters. The data are consistent with systematic vote switching and ballot stuffing in precincts large enough to justify the effort. (No sense monkeying with the machines in a precinct that only has a small number of voters.)
