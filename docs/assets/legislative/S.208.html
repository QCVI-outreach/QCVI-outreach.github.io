Legislative Action - Bill S.208
</H1>

<h2><a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2026/S.208" target="_blank">S.208</a>: An act relating to standards for law enforcement identification</h2>

<strong>S.208</strong>
would set clear statewide standards requiring law enforcement
— including federal officers operating in Vermont —
to
<strong>identify themselves by name or badge number</strong>
and
<strong>not wear masks or disguises</strong>
during public
<p>

<h3>Amendment</h3>
I believe the transparency provided by this bill is essential for
public safety and trust. To further strengthen the intent of this legislation, I
would like to propose an addendum requiring the clear identification of federal
immigration enforcement vehicles operating within our state.

<h3>Mandatory Marking of Federal Enforcement Vehicles</h3>
Any vehicle operated by federal agencies engaged in civil immigration
enforcement within the State of Vermont shall be clearly and conspicuously
identified. Such identification shall include, but not be limited to, distinctive
license plate designations or high-visibility markings that distinguish these
vehicles from local law enforcement and civilian transport.

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Public Safety & accountability: Unmarked or non-distinct vehicles used for enforcement operations create public confusion and "vigilante" anxiety.</li>
	<li>Prevention of Coercive Mimicry</li>
	<li>Accountability in public spaces</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>To be honest this matters to me because...</li>
	<li>I know you have a lot on your plate, but I’d love to see Vermont lead the way on this.</li>
	<li>Thanks for taking the time to read this and for all the work you do for our community!</li>

</ul>
