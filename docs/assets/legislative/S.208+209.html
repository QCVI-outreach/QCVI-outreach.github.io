Legislative Action - Bills S.208 &amp; S.209
</H1>

<h2>S.208: Outlaw masks by ICE</h2>


<strong>The Legislative session in Montpelier has begun and there are some bills that might really make a difference in protecting us from the awful abuse we saw in Minneapolis when a masked ICE agent shot Renee Good, an unarmed, nonviolent US citizen. The first one up is S.208 which proposes that all local, state, and federal law enforcement officers clearly identify themselves by name or badge number. It also prohibits masks or personal disguises (with certain exceptions). It would limit law enforcement from acting without personal responsibility, and prevent kidnappers from masquerading as legitimate law enforcement. You can see the whole bill (3 pages) and follow its progress here. Reach out to these key decision-makers:</strong>

<h2>S.209: Prohibit Civil Arrests in Sensitive Areas</h2>
<p>
<strong>The bill would prohibit civil arrests while traveling to, entering,remaining at,or returning from certain "sensitive locations".  "Civil arrest" in this context generally means non-criminal detentions, such as those often carried out by ICE.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sensitive areas include: schools; court proceedings; state, county or municipal buildings; health care facilities, community shelters, and emergency housing.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>S.209 is also now under consideration in the VT Senate Judiciary Committee.  You can follow its progress here.
Reach out to the same decision makers above.</strong>
