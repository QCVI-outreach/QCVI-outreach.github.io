Thanks for your interest.

Indivisible ( https://indivisible.org/ ) is a grassroots movement of thousands of local groups
  with a mission to elect progressive leaders, rebuild our democracy, and defeat the Trump agenda.

Welcome to "Queen City VT Indivisible" ( https://queencityvtindivisible.org/ ),
  and we're pleased and excited at your interest.

It's early days for our group in Burlington and we're just getting organized.
Our first big activity is on April 5 when TWO rallies are planned. Come to either one and tell all your friends:
Saturday April 5 at Noon, at two locations:
- Burlington: City Hall Steps, Church Street
- Montpelier: Vermont State Capitol, 115 State Street

Both events are dedicated to nonviolent expression of our resolve to resist the destruction of our American Democracy.
  We do not consent to the destruction of our health care, our jobs, our services, our economy, and our rights by Trump and his billionaire cabal.

So far, over 500 people have said they're coming! That's a big crowd and
we will need some help to make it safe and enjoyable for everyone:
- Marshals to guide and assist folks in the crowd. No experience necessary. (Reply to this email for more details.)
- Clean up crew to stay after and help tidy up. (Reply to this email for more details.)
- Money. Our core group has already personally committed about $1,000 for permits and supplies,
  and we need to reimburse them to keep this movement alive.
  Please donate using Venmo (@QCVTIndivisible), or bring cash to the rally. Every little bit helps!

Spread the word and bring all your friends and family! See you Saturday!
