The first one up is <strong>S.208</strong> which proposes that all local, state, and federal law enforcement officers clearly identify themselves by name or badge number...

<p><strong>Next up is the nomination of</strong> <strong>Michael Drescher</strong> <strong>for a lifetime appointment to our Vermont Supreme Court. He is the U.S. Attorney who defended the kidnapping, transportation and detention of both</strong> <strong>Rumeysa Ozturk&nbsp;</strong><strong>and</strong> <strong>Mohsen Mahdawi.</strong> <strong>The decision makers are as above (except that the Governor already nominated Drescher, so not so useful)...</strong>
