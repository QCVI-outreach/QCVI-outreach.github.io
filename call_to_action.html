<p>The Legislative session in Montpelier has begun and there are some bills that might really make a difference in protecting us from the awful abuse we saw in Minneapolis when a masked ICE agent shot Renee Good, an unarmed, nonviolent US citizen. The first one up is <strong>S.208</strong> which proposes that all local, state, and federal law enforcement officers clearly identify themselves by name or badge number...
