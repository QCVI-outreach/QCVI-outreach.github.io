		Bring a bench, chair or cushion, warm clothes, blanket, hand and feet warmers, umbrella. Our meditative sit is an opportunity to work with the challenging energy of this time energy which manifests in many ways, including the suffering caused by ICE in our community, in our world, and in our hearts. Our aspiration is not to judge the people who work in the building, but to change the energy that leads to present attitudes and policies.
		</h4><h4>
		If you choose to bring a sign, we hope that your message will respectfully raise questions about ICE's policies and actions, and convey our appreciation for migrants, and their right to fair and legal treatment. More info: <A HREF="mailto:annedamrosch@gmail.com">Anne Damrosch</A>.
