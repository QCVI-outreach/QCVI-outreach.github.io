Call to Action!

<h2>Ask the VT Senate to rein in abusive federal agents</h2>
<p>We've been active supporters of S.208 (Law Enforcement Identification -no masks) and S.209 (No civil arrests in sensitive locations). Thanks in no small part to your messages to the Senate Judiciary Committee, these bills are on their way to a vote by the full Senate. So, <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/people/search/2026" target="_blank">find your senators</a>' contact info and call or write to make sure they know where you stand on ICE in our towns. &nbsp;Perhaps something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
Re: S.208 &amp; S.209
<br>Dear [Sen. __________]
<p>I'm writing today to express my support for S.208 (Law Enforcement Identification)
and S.209 (No civil arrests in sensitive areas).
<br>These are the least we should do as a state to protect ourselves from
the abusive practices of federal forces under the command of autocrats and fascists.
<br>I look forward to your vote on these measures.
<br>Thanks for all your hard work.
<p>[Your name]
<br>[Town]
</blockquote>

		Bring a bench, chair or cushion, warm clothes, blanket, hand and feet warmers, umbrella. Our meditative sit is an opportunity to work with the challenging energy of this time energy which manifests in many ways, including the suffering caused by ICE in our community, in our world, and in our hearts.
